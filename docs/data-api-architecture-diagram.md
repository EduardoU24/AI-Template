# OpenDND Framework: Architectural Diagrams

## 1. Modular Dependency Graph
The relationship between files in a **Plugin Pod** and their interaction with the core.

```mermaid
graph RL
    subgraph Plugin_Pod ["/plugins/projects"]
        Data["data.ts (Types/Seeds)"]
        Srv["service.ts (Logic)"]
        UI["ui/ (Co-located Components)"]
        Idx["index.ts (Public Export)"]
    end

    subgraph Core_Services ["/service"]
        Base["index.ts (CRUD Factory)"]
        Provider["provider.ts (Strategy Manager)"]
    end

    subgraph App_Router ["/app"]
        Page["(admin)/dashboard/projects/page.tsx"]
    end

    Srv -- "Registers Seeds" --> Base
    Page -- "Consumes" --> Idx
    Srv -- "Uses" --> Base
    Base -- "Requests" --> Provider
```

## 2. Data Flow Architecture
How a user interaction reaches the data store.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI as App Component (page.tsx)
    participant Srv as Plugin Service (service.ts)
    participant Core as Base Service (service/index.ts)
    participant Prov as Provider (strategy-memory.ts)

    UI->>Srv: ProjectService.findAllMy()
    Srv->>Core: base.findAll()
    Core->>Prov: provider.get('projects')
    Prov-->>Core: { data: [...] }
    Core-->>Srv: { data: [...] }
    Srv-->>UI: { data: [User's Projects] }
```
